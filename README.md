**Co-creating an Object Recognition Exergame with Hospital Service Users to Promote Physical Activity**

It is challenging to encourage hospital service users with mental health conditions to engage in physical activity despite its proven benefits. Technological implementation, such as mobile games could offer a method of improving healthcare delivery without significant cost. Co-design helps create a sense of empowerment and a feeling of competence, which benefits the participants as they derive satisfaction and fun while feeling useful through their participation. Therefore, we propose the co-creation of objects using papier-mâché for use within an AI exergame whereby hospital service users and staff construct co-created models that are placed along a mile long walk around the grounds for use within the game. This enables a novel approach to gamify exercise and promote physical activity by developing a smartphone app that encourages hospital service users to search for and scan co-created objects around the hospital grounds. The game has successfully engaged hospital service users as they both enjoyed the active gamified experience and took ownership of the co-designed objects used within the game.
